## Introduction

The **Network Packet Sniffer Web Application** is designed to capture and display network packets in real-time. Utilizing Flask for the web interface and Scapy for packet sniffing, this application provides a user-friendly way to monitor network traffic and access packet data through a RESTful API.

## Features

- **Real-time Packet Capture**: Sniffs network packets and stores them in a SQLite database.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to start sniffing, configure packet capture, and view packet data.
- **API Access**: Provides a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve packet data in JSON format.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Network Packet Sniffer Web Application up and running on your local machine.

### Recommended

- Works well on various network interfaces.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to capture network packets on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Scapy
- SQLite

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-sniffer-web-app.git
   cd packet-sniffer-web-app

2. Install the required dependencies:
      ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. The SQLite database will be automatically created when you run the application for the first time.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5500.

3. Use the web interface to start packet sniffing by specifying the number of packets and filter type, then view the captured packet data in the table.

4. Access the packet data via the API at http://localhost:5500/api/packets.
      
## Example

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py

2. Fetch packet data via API:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5500/api/packets

   
3. Example JSON Response:
   ```bash
   [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "timestamp": "2024-09-05T12:34:56",
        "ip_src": "192.168.1.1",
        "ip_dst": "192.168.1.2",
        "tcp_sport": 12345,
        "tcp_dport": 80,
        "payload": "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n..."
    }
   ]
